**Plant monitoring system**

The main goal of this project is to develop an IoT system to allow monitoring the environmental conditions
as well as the health of a plant throughout its life. This could allow vendors, for example, to adjust the final
price of special plants, like bonsais or very delicate plants, for which the environmental conditions it have
suffered throughout their lives are crucial. The system could also be useful as a monitoring system in
greenhouses by monitoring several plants randomly. 

The project is based on the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa®/Sigfox™ Discovery kit and several sensors for monitoring all the required parameters.
